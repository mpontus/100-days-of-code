# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Submitted a PR to introduce Docker into development process for the app our study group is developing.

**Thoughts:** Will need revisiting once build process has been put in place.

### Day 2: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed decoupling my external dev server for create-react-app from react-scripts.

**Thoughts:** Not satisfied with how decoupling is going. I should probably try looking less at react-scripts and try to find a better approach, if I want to avoid reliance on their tooling. Automated testing is an interesting thought. Might spend an hour another day trying it out.
