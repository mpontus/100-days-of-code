# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Submitted a PR to introduce Docker into development process for the app our study group is developing.

**Thoughts:** Will need revisiting once build process has been put in place.

4. [library/node - Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/)

### Day 2: July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed decoupling my external dev server for create-react-app from react-scripts.

**Thoughts:** Not satisfied with how decoupling is going. I should probably try looking less at react-scripts and try to find a better approach, if I want to avoid reliance on their tooling. Automated testing is an interesting thought. Might spend an hour another day trying it out.

### Day 3: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Published [Atom](https://atom.io/) package which enables tab rotation mechanism I've been missing.

**Thoughts:** This mechanism has been essential to my web browsing experience, and by this day I haven't been able to apply it anywhere else but [Pentadactyl](https://github.com/5digits/dactyl). Authoring in Atom is nice. I'd love to put out a simliar CLI tool for emacs at some point.
